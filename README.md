Pharmacy
--------

[Pharmacy](http://pharmacy.leibniz-fli.de/admin/pharmadoc/pharmacy/).
The pharmacy is the medicine. The name is composed of the name of the
pharmacy and the dose of the active molecule. It's possible to set an "alarm value" for a pharmacy. If this value is set, the "Admin"  receives a mail, if the containers in stock is less then this value for this pharmacy. The available stock of a pharmacy is calculated from all active orders belonging to the pharmacy. The unit of a pharmacy (e.g. gram, milligram, milliliters) is a calculated field from the orders. Ever order has to be the same unit. If not the unit of the pharmacy is false. This is obviously impractical but has not yet led to problems. 

Order
-----

[Order](http://pharmacy.leibniz-fli.de/admin/pharmadoc/order/).
An Order increase the stock of a pharmacy. Every order gets an
identifier from the system. The identifier is composed of the first
three letters of the name of the pharmacy or if set the "identifier shortcut" of the pharmacy and the delivery date. If
there is already an order with the designated identifier the new
identifier gets a ongoing number as last character. Every order belongs
to a pharmacy and have a state `active` or `deactivated`. It turns
automatically to `deactivated` if all containers are submitted. In case
of reaching the expiry date or something else the status can be set
manually. It isn\'t possible to create a new submissions from a order
which is set to `deactivated`.
